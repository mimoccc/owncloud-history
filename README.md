History app
===========

This repository provides a small plugin for ownCloud to enable change tracking for each user, like e.g. Dropbox does with the "Recent Events" page.

The app is under development. Logging of create, edit, rename and delete actions works, but the frontend is not linked to the navigation bar.

However it can be called with `/index.php/apps/files_history`.
